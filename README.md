# BookNook: Bookstore Application with Admin Dashboard

## About

This project originated from a class assignment for the Advanced Web Development course at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The initial version was built as a full-stack application using Python and Flask. Given the tight two-week deadline, my team and I chose Flask due to our familiarity with Python and the need for rapid development. You can view a presentation video of the original project [here](https://youtu.be/RSr8QvNLZOE) and explore the code [here](https://github.com/francoisdillinger/CS421-FinalProj).

While the initial project successfully implemented a full-stack bookstore application with CRUD functionality, it lacked visual appeal. With a strong interest in data visualization, I decided to rebuild the application from scratch, incorporating an admin dashboard to enhance the learning experience and visual presentation.

## Examples

### Homepage
The homepage serves as the landing page for the site. While the design is not final (I am ***not*** a designer), I attempted to create a cohesive look and feel for the project, including the logo. This project is a solo effort, so any design flaws are my own. ðŸ˜…

### Search/Browse Products Page
This page allows users to browse or search for products, with sorting options based on ratings, reviews, and categories/genres.

### Admin Dashboard
The admin dashboard serves as the control center for managing the site. Admin users can view data visualizations for **Authors**, **Categories**, and **Users**. The dashboard features a line chart displaying orders over time, a bar chart for overall totals, and a donut chart showing orders as a percentage of total orders. The **Highlight** dropdown allows for isolating specific data points.

## Tech Stack

1. **React**
2. **React Router**
3. **React Redux**
4. **Framer Motion** (animations)
5. **D3** (data visualizations)
6. **Tailwind CSS**
7. **TypeScript** (transitioning to industry standard)

## Overview

This project is a continuous work in progress, but the provided images offer a glimpse into the envisioned functionality and design. The project has been a valuable learning experience, involving constant refinements and the discovery of more efficient methods. For instance, I initially built animations manually, only to later integrate Framer Motion for consistency.

### Current Status

- **Frontend**: Utilizing dummy data for development.
- **Backend**: Ongoing bug fixes and improvements. Code can be seen [here](https://github.com/francoisdillinger/booknook_graphql_api).

### Future Plans

- **Installation Instructions**: Will be provided upon project completion.
- **Live Demo**: A live version of the site is planned for the future.

Thank you for checking out my project! Stay tuned for updates as the development progresses.
